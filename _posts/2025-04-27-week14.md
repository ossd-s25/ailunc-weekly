title: Week 14 | Presentations
---

This week was really exciting because we had two project presentations lined up â€” one from our classmates on **Preswald**, and one from our team on **Huggingface**.

## Preswald Presentation

Our classmates introduced us to **Preswald**, a tool focused on building data visualization dashboards using **Python** and **HTML**. It's structured around an **Open Core** model, where the base software is free, but customizations are paid.

They talked about the community structure around Preswald â€” including a small but active subreddit and responsive maintainers. However, they also pointed out challenges like a poorly managed Slack channel and sluggish issue/PR responses.

In terms of their actual contributions, the highlights were:
- Implementing **LaTeX support**
- Working on **sidebar functionality** (which was tricky due to token handling)
- Building an **interactive chat interface** based on their documentation
- Adding a **debug panel** for better development and testing

They also reflected honestly on the difficulties they faced: lack of documentation, needing to learn the underlying tech from scratch, fast changes to the base code, and some frustration over the limited community support.

A cool tip they shared was how important it was to **get on calls with the developers** directly, and that a **contributing guide** would have made onboarding a lot smoother.

## Huggingface Presentation

Our team presented our work on **Huggingface ðŸ¤—**, one of the biggest names in the open-source AI space.

We walked through:
- What Huggingface does (open-source models like Transformers and Diffusers, huge datasets like Wikipedia and COCO)
- Our contribution statistics (22 contributions: 11 PRs and 11 issues across features, bug fixes, documentation, community support, etc.)
- How we communicated on Slack, coordinated our pull requests, and divided up work

Each of us shared our **individual contributions**:
- **Haocheng** worked on bug fixes (like correcting position ID increments), documentation fixes, and feature improvements for Qwen2 MoE models.
- **Yufeng** focused on bug fixes, type consistency improvements, and issues related to KV cache generation.
- **Haochen** also contributed bug fixes and clarified tricky logic in the code.
- **Minjun** handled documentation, added tests for new cache mechanisms, and introduced resume checkpoint functionality for ClearML.

For our **group contribution**, we highlighted how we implemented a **time-based evaluation, saving, and logging strategy** for the Huggingface Trainer â€” making it more consistent across different hardware setups.  
We even created **three different test scenarios** to verify that the time-based strategies worked reliably!

## Final Thoughts

It was really interesting to see the contrast between the two projects:  
- **Preswald** is smaller, scrappier, and still building its foundation, while  
- **Huggingface** is a massive, polished open-source community with structured contribution processes.

Both presentations made it clear that no matter the size of the project, successful contributions rely on:
- Understanding the codebase
- Clear communication
- Careful testing
- And perseverance in navigating project challenges

Really proud of what everyone achieved this week! ðŸŽ‰
