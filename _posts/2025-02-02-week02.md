title: Week 2 | Code of Conduct
---
Recently in class we tackled the [Code of Conduct activity](https://github.com/joannakl/ossd_materials/blob/master/activities/code_of_conduct_activity.md) where we dipped our toes into a few different documents—the Go Project’s Code of Conduct, the Contributor Covenant, and the Eclipse Code of Conduct. We only skimmed the surface during our discussions, so I’m taking this chance to dive a bit deeper into my personal take on each one. I’ll break down what I liked, what got me thinking, and how these codes shape the vibe and interactions in open source communities. Plus, I'll throw in some thoughts from the video [How to Drive Consensus and Transparency Within Open Source Communities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYwTDNA3Uac). Let’s jump in!

[Go Project Code of Conduct](https://go.dev/conduct)

When you're part of an active open source project or any community-driven effort, it's incredibly valuable to have a document that sets out the ground rules for how everyone interacts. The Go project’s code of conduct is a great example of this in action. Essentially, it spells out what kind of behavior is expected and, just as importantly, what isn’t acceptable. It’s like having a friendly reminder at the door that says, "We’re all here to work together and treat each other with respect."

What really stands out about this kind of document is that it creates a safe, welcoming environment for everyone, no matter who they are or where they’re coming from. By being upfront about the need for respectful communication and inclusivity, it encourages a diverse mix of people to contribute without the fear of being sidelined by negativity or harassment. When people know that there’s a clear commitment to a respectful atmosphere, they’re more likely to join in and share their ideas, even if those ideas challenge the status quo.

Another big plus is how it handles conflicts. Disagreements are bound to happen in any community, but having a set of guidelines means that there’s a roadmap for resolving those disputes before they escalate into something more serious. It’s not about stifling debate—in fact, healthy discussion is encouraged—but it’s about making sure that debates don’t turn personal or unproductive. When everyone’s held to the same standard, it creates a culture where people feel accountable for their words and actions.

What I find really compelling is that a code of conduct isn’t just a set of rules; it’s a commitment to fostering a community where empathy and thoughtful communication are the norm. It invites everyone to be a little more patient, to consider how their words might be interpreted, and to really think about the impact they have on others. This kind of mindset goes a long way in making a project not only successful but also a genuinely enjoyable place to be.

Honestly, I think every project, big or small, could benefit from having something like this. It’s a proactive way to help avoid misunderstandings and ensure that every voice is heard in a respectful and supportive environment. Whether you're a long-time contributor or someone just considering getting involved, knowing there’s a shared commitment to kindness and constructive dialogue makes all the difference.

[Contributer Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/)

After checking out both the Go project’s code of conduct and the Contributor Covenant, a couple of interesting differences stand out—and it’s fun to think about why the Go team might have tweaked things a bit for their community.

One thing that really jumps out in the Go document is the inclusion of a dedicated section for “Gopher values.” This part isn’t just about listing rules; it’s more like a friendly guide to how every community member is encouraged to behave, with reminders to be patient, thoughtful, and constructive. By contrast, the Contributor Covenant sticks to a more straightforward outline of expectations and examples without that extra sprinkle of community personality. It seems like the Go team wanted to create a tone that resonates with its unique identity—a way to remind everyone that being a “Gopher” isn’t just about contributing code, but also about embodying a certain spirit of collaboration and kindness.

Another noticeable difference is in how conflict resolution and enforcement are handled. The Go project’s code of conduct goes into a bit more detail about what to do if things start to go off track. It offers specific instructions and contact points (like emailing conduct@golang.org), and it even lays out the philosophy behind resolving disagreements. The Contributor Covenant, while it does cover enforcement and provides a process for handling complaints, takes a more high-level approach with less detail. It might be that the Go project, which is part of a larger ecosystem and backed by big names like Google, felt the need to be extra clear and precise in how conflicts should be managed. This clarity not only helps in dealing with issues as they arise but also builds trust within a diverse, global community.

Overall, these tweaks seem aimed at making the Go project’s code of conduct more personalized and detailed. The Go team likely wanted to ensure that their document not only sets clear standards but also feels welcoming and tailored to their specific community vibe. And honestly, that kind of approach can help keep things friendly and productive—qualities that any project can appreciate.

[Eclipse Code of Conduct](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php)

When you compare Eclipse’s Code of Conduct with the one used by the Go project, it’s easy to see that each document has its own personality and structure, and that usually comes down to the unique needs of each community.

For instance, the Eclipse document is a lot more formal and detailed. It includes a wide range of sections like “Investigation of Potential Code Violations,” “Actions,” and “No Retaliation,” which really spells out the steps to be taken in any problematic situation. There’s even mention of timeframes—like the effort to resolve issues within 60 days—and explicit roles for Staff, Committers, Project Leads, and a Conduct Committee. This level of detail is likely because Eclipse is part of a larger organization with many different projects and a more complex governance structure. They need to ensure that there’s clear accountability and a formal process that protects everyone involved, which can be important not only for internal consistency but also for legal and reputational reasons.

On the other hand, the Go project’s code of conduct feels more community-driven and a bit more personal. It talks about “Gopher values” and lays out the expectations in a way that’s very much in line with the friendly, open culture that many in the Go community appreciate. The focus here is on creating a welcoming space and ensuring that debates remain respectful rather than getting bogged down in the legalistic or bureaucratic side of things.

In short, the Eclipse version is structured with a lot of detail and formalities to manage a larger, more diverse set of participants and situations. It’s designed to work within an organization that has multiple layers of responsibility and public accountability. Meanwhile, the Go project's approach is a bit more streamlined and infused with the community’s unique spirit. Each approach reflects the culture, size, and operational needs of the respective projects, which is why you’ll see such different structures and content between the two.

[Sugar Lab Code of Conduct](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Legal/Code_of_Conduct)

The Sugar Labs Code of Conduct is pretty interesting when you compare it to the Go project's version. One of the most obvious points is that the Sugar Labs document actually tells you its origins—it’s based on the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. That little note at the bottom is a clear indicator that Sugar Labs borrowed its framework from Ubuntu’s approach.

Beyond that, the overall feel of the Sugar Labs document is different from Go’s. Sugar Labs takes a more community and educational approach, which fits its focus on educators, children, and developers who work together on the Sugar Learning Platform. Its tone emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and stepping aside considerately when it’s time to move on. In other words, it’s less about a formal set of rules for handling technical contributions and more about creating a friendly, respectful, and nurturing environment for learning and cooperation.

In contrast, the Go project’s code of conduct is geared toward ensuring a safe, welcoming space in a technical, open-source context. It lays out clear guidelines for respectful debate and details ways to resolve conflicts, which is really important for the kind of collaborative development that happens in the Go community.

So, in short, yes—the Sugar Labs document is based on another code of conduct (Ubuntu’s) and has been adapted to suit the specific needs of a community that’s as much about education and exploration as it is about software development. This makes it a great example of how different projects tailor their codes to match their community’s goals and values.

[Docker Code of Conduct](https://github.com/docker/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct-EN.md)

When you look at Docker’s Code of Conduct alongside the Eclipse and Sugar Labs templates, you quickly notice that while all three aim to create welcoming, safe, and respectful communities, they each have their own flavor that reflects the culture and operational style of their projects.

For starters, Docker’s code is very straightforward and to the point. It opens by making it clear that harassment in any form isn’t tolerated—whether that happens online, in-person, or even during one-on-one interactions. There’s a strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion, which is great because it underlines that everyone, no matter their background, is welcome. Docker’s document then moves on to list expected behaviors (like being professional, kind, and respectful) and spells out what counts as unacceptable (harassment, intimidation, and the like). This list format gives it a very clear, easy-to-digest structure, which is especially useful at events or conferences where quick reference is needed.

Now, if you compare that to the Eclipse Code of Conduct, you’ll notice that Eclipse’s version is more formal and detailed. Eclipse doesn’t just state what the rules are—it sets out a comprehensive framework that covers everything from the investigation process to enforcement procedures and even timeframes for resolving issues. It’s designed to operate within a larger organizational structure, where multiple projects and diverse groups of people interact. The Eclipse approach is meticulous about roles, responsibilities, and the chain of command, which makes sense given the size and complexity of the community they serve.

On the flip side, the Sugar Labs Code of Conduct has a noticeably different vibe. It’s rooted in the spirit of Ubuntu’s Code of Conduct and is tailored to a community that’s as much about education and exploration as it is about software development. Sugar Labs’ document emphasizes core values like collaboration, respect, and flexibility—reflecting its focus on educators, children, and developers. It’s less about formal enforcement processes and more about fostering an environment where creativity and learning thrive. The tone is warmer and encourages members to work together and support one another, which fits perfectly with a community that values sharing and cooperation.

So why do these differences matter? Essentially, each project has crafted its code of conduct to best fit its community’s needs. Docker’s version is clear, concise, and heavily focused on creating a harassment-free space in various settings—from digital to in-person. Eclipse’s detailed framework supports its complex, multi-layered organizational structure and ensures accountability across a wide network of contributors. Meanwhile, Sugar Labs’ more relaxed, value-driven approach reflects its emphasis on open collaboration and learning in a community that’s as much about nurturing creativity as it is about coding.

In the end, these variations show that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for fostering a respectful and inclusive community. Each project adapts the core ideas of fairness, respect, and inclusion to the unique context of its own community, ensuring that the rules work well for the people who are actually using them every day.
