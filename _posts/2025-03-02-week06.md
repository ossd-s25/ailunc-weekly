title: Week 6 | Contributions So Far
---

I’ve been feeling pretty good about my recent contributions—they may be small, but they’re definitely making a difference. It’s cool to see that little fixes, like tweaking the “readmore” placement on a classmate’s blog or sorting out some markdown quirks, actually improve the experience for everyone involved. I spent some time refining OpenStreetMap details too, which was a neat change because even a slight update there helps others navigate better, and it reminds me that every bit counts.

One of the bigger hurdles has been diving into projects that sometimes have overwhelming issues to sort through. With projects like these, it’s easy to feel lost in a sea of tasks, but breaking things down into manageable fixes—like addressing typos on Wikipedia or reporting a missing image on the course website—has really helped me build confidence. Even when I hit a snag, it’s rewarding to know that there’s a community behind the project willing to support your progress.

Looking back, I think I’m most proud of the contribution where I added a Code of Conduct to a GitHub project. It might sound like a minor administrative tweak, but setting a respectful and clear tone for a project felt like a solid step in nurturing a healthier community. It reminds me that sometimes the smallest changes can create the biggest impact. Overall, every line of code and every bug fix has been a learning experience that makes me even more excited about what lies ahead in this open source journey.
