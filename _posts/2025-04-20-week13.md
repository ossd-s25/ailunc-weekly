## Group Progress

Last week our team made solid strides on our Transformer‑based contributions:

- **Apr 16**: Submitted **PR #37596**, which adds comprehensive tests for the new Tensor Parallel integration.  
- **Apr 20**: Merged **PR #37635** to introduce “resume checkpoint” support in the ClearML callback, complete with a dedicated test file.  
- **Apr 20**: Responded to **Issue #37627** by providing a base code template for fine‑tuning the SigLIP2 model, helping the issue opener get started quickly.

- **Now**: Submitted **PR #36310** — **Add time‑based evaluation strategy to Trainer**.  
  - **What it does**: Introduces time‑based evaluation, saving, and logging to the Hugging Face `Trainer`, so you can configure intervals in minutes rather than steps.  
  - **Why it matters**:  
    - Ensures consistent evaluation/logging across hardware of varying speeds (CPU vs. GPU).  
    - Guards against lost progress by saving checkpoints at fixed time intervals.  
    - Allows real‑time monitoring of training progress.  
  - **Sample configuration**:
    ```python
    training_args = TrainingArguments(
        output_dir="./test_output",
        eval_strategy=IntervalStrategy.TIME,      # Evaluate every N minutes
        eval_minutes=1,

        save_strategy=IntervalStrategy.TIME,      # Save every N minutes
        save_minutes=1,

        logging_strategy=IntervalStrategy.TIME,   # Log every N minutes
        logging_minutes=1,

        per_device_train_batch_size=8,
        num_train_epochs=200,
    )
    ```
  - **Status**: Fixes #36310. Waiting for reviewer feedback.

## Video Insights: “Open Core” in Business

In our industry video, Joseph Jacks, Scott McCarty, Ray Pick, and others dove deep into the concept of **Open Core**:

- **Open Core vs. Closed Core**  
  - **Open Core companies** publish a fully functional, open‑source core—often 99% of end‑user value—and monetize add‑ons, cloud services, or premium features.  
  - **Closed Core companies** keep their core technology proprietary and exclusively monetize access to that core.  

- **Not a Single Business Model**  
  Open Core isn’t tied to one way of making money. Companies may simultaneously sell support, managed services, t‑shirts, or proprietary extensions around the open core project.

- **Community Contributions & Trust**  
  Transparent contribution guidelines, open roadmaps, and clear stewardship policies (e.g., GitLab’s “feature proposal evaluation” checklist) build trust and encourage both vendor and individual contributions.

- **Historical Baggage**  
  Early Open Core players sometimes shipped “crippleware” community editions, creating controversy around whether the free core was “seriously usable.” Today’s leaders like HashiCorp, Confluent, and Databricks have shown that a healthy Open Core can drive massive adoption without compromising quality.

- **Terminology Matters**  
  While some view “Open Core” as pejorative, the panel concluded that distinguishing **Open Core** (company type) from **Open Source** (technology license) and **Closed Core** (proprietary) helps clarify strategy and internal culture.

## In‑Class Discussion

Building on the video, our class explored why organizations choose Open Core:

1. **User Hook & Upsell**  
   Offer a generous free tier to onboard users, then convert power users with premium features (e.g., advanced clustering in Redis Enterprise).

2. **Ecosystem Lock‑In vs. True Openness**  
   Proprietary extensions can create deeper lock‑in, but a fully open core—with multiple vendors competing to provide services—delivers stronger freedom and flexibility for customers.

3. **Cultural Alignment**  
   Open Core companies often embrace open decision‑making practices, publish design docs, and invite community input into their roadmaps—aligning internal culture with the ethos of their codebase.

4. **Label Sensitivity**  
   For some, the term “Open Core” conjures negative memories of under‑featured community editions. We debated whether a fresh label (e.g., “Commercial Open Source”) might avoid that baggage—but agreed clear definitions and transparent policies matter more than the buzzword itself.
