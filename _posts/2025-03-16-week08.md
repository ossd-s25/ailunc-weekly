title: Week 8 | Presentation Reflection
---

This week was all about open source in action, and I got to sit in on two really insightful presentations. One of the talks challenged some of the basic ideas I had about what open source truly means, especially in the realm of AI. It turns out that the traditional definition is being questioned, with some big players pushing for a looser, more flexible interpretation. I found this pretty surprising, as it made me wonder if we should start thinking of open source in layers rather than a single, rigid category.

The discussion around open sourcing training data was a standout moment. I always assumed that sharing data was an all-or-nothing deal—either everything is open or nothing is. But the presenter broke it down in a way that showed it’s more about sharing the roadmap rather than the raw ingredients. This perspective didn’t just change my view on the practicality of open source AI; it made it seem like a much more achievable goal than I’d ever considered.

The second presentation offered a deep dive into how open source is making waves in the financial industry. I’d never really connected the dots between open source projects and finance before, and it was eye-opening to see how much value financial institutions can derive from open source innovations. With the right compliance measures and security protocols in place, the idea that sensitive financial data could be leveraged responsibly really resonated with me. It seems like the benefits of transparency and collaborative problem solving could significantly enhance trust and innovation in finance.

After these presentations, my ideas about open source AI and its broader applications have definitely evolved. I still believe in the core values of openness and collaboration, but now I see a more nuanced picture where practical considerations can coexist with idealistic goals. It’s not just about giving away code or data; it’s about empowering communities to build, learn, and innovate in a responsible way.

Looking back on this week, I’m energized by the potential that open source holds—not only in technology but also in industries like finance that have traditionally been more closed off. The talks reaffirmed that while there are challenges ahead, the future of open source AI is promising, and its impact could be far-reaching if we continue to embrace both its ideals and its practicalities.
